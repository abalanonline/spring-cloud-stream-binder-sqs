This repository contains the code for the Spring Cloud Stream Binder implementation for AWS SQS.

Implementation is heavily inspired by https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-aws-kinesis[Spring Cloud Stream Binder Kinesis] and uses https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-aws[Spring Cloud AWS] under the hood.

**It's a very early stage project, not battle-tested, not production-ready**.

You're welcome to leave feedback and PRs are even more than welcome ðŸ˜€
